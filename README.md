# Pokédex

## Description

Pokédex is a Single Page Application (SPA) developed in React.js that allows users to explore detailed information about each Pokémon, just like in Pokémon games and anime.

## Features

- Theme toggler between Light and Dark themes
- Pokémon search by name and ID
- Pokémon filtering by type
- Viewing details of each Pokémon, including moves and abilities

## Technologies Used

- [React.js](https://react.dev/): Chosen for its efficiency in creating SPAs
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/)
- [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/): Adopted for styling components and creating the Theme Toggler.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main): Used for navigation between application pages.

## Decisions Made

- **Figma Prototype**: I created the UI prototype in Figma, which made my workflow smoother as I knew how the design of my application would look.

- **PokeAPI**: This API is designed in a simple and easy-to-use way, with a wide variety of data and images for each Pokémon. I love how the game arts were pixelated, so I decided to use this aesthetic despite the ease of switching to any other.

- **Theme Toggler**: I created themes to improve the user experience, allowing them to switch between Light and Dark themes.

- **Vanilla Extract**: I used this library to style the components for its practicality and being a Zero-runtime Stylesheets, providing better performance than other libraries.

- **React Router**: I used this library to facilitate navigation between different pages of the application.
